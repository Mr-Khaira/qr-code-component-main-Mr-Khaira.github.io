## My process

First I added all the html then I added the css accodingly, using the
desktop first approch, but for future I will use the mobile first approch.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mosh Hamedani lectures

### What I learned

I leaned that a inline element cannot contain a block level element in html, I tried to add
a <div> inside a <p>.
I also got to know that the best method to add google fonts is to import it in the
css file rather than linking it in the html file.
I used flex for putting the qr code card in the center as well as adjusting
the content of the card itself.
I studied media queries also.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I am looking forword to understand and apply animations, and learn how to better
structure my code for professionalism.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://members.codewithmosh.com/) - This helped me with the media qureies, box shadow and basically everything.
